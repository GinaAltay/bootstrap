    <h2 class="card-title m-3">What is strength training?</h2>
    <p class="card-text text-center" >If you could do one thing to improve your health, strength training should be at the top of your list. It involves using one or more muscle groups to perform a specific task,
     such as lifting a weight or squatting.

     Strength training is also known as weight training, resistance training, and muscular training.
     
     The general definition of strength training is any physical movement in which you use your body weight or equipment ( dumbbells and resistance bands) to build muscle mass, strength, and endurance.
     
     The main types of strength training include :
     
     Muscular hypertrophy. Also known as muscle building, this type of strength training uses moderate-to-heavy weights to stimulate muscle growth.</p>

  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3"></h4>
 
  <p>NASM warns that you should not jump straight to training for hypertrophy. You need to first develop a strong foundation and move into a more advanced phase once you have a stable base.

    Also, when first starting out, you may not be likely to see major gains in size right away. According to a 2018 reviewTrusted Source, when you first start out, you will gain strength rapidly at first, along with neural adaptations. After the initial strength gains, you will likely start to see some slow, but likely steady gains in size.</p>

    <p class="m-3 " >  Exercise selection can make a difference in your overall resistance training program. Training for hypertrophy or strength benefits from a multiple-joint approach.

    In other words, your routines should include exercises that involve several muscle groups and joints in one action — these are often called compound exercises. Squats, deadlifts, and rows are a few examples of exercises that involve several muscle groups in one action.
    
    For hypertrophy, working several groups at once may promote uniform growth. For strength, working multiple groups at once can improve overall strength.</p>

    <p>To increase muscular endurance, ACE recommend a combination of lower and upper body exercises, with strengthening exercises to target the whole body.

    Moderate resistance training, with short intervals in between for rest, creates short bursts of tension to build strength.
    
    Circuit or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be a suitable way to combine cardio and strength training into one workout.
    
    Unless a person’s fitness goals involve training for a particular endurance-based sport, training for muscular endurance alone may not be the most appropriate strategy.
    
    The best exercise programs mix strength and muscular endurance training.
    
    Some evidence also suggests that exercise programs that people find enjoyable may be more likely to generate long-term benefits, as they may be more likely to stick with them.
    
    
  Resistance training helps your muscles adapt or change. In addition to strength and hypertrophy adaptations, resistance training can help with:

    muscular endurance: ability to produce and maintain force for a long period of time
    power: ability to produce the most amount of force in the shortest period of time, also known as explosive power
    stability: helps with range of motion and stability around the joints.
